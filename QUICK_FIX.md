# 🚀 Quick Fix: Restart HuggingFace Spaces

Your code is all fixed and pushed to GitHub. The spaces just need to be **restarted to deploy**.

## 3 Simple Steps:

### Step 1: Restart AI Engine

1. Go to: https://huggingface.co/spaces/cosmicmagnetar/opentriage-ai
2. Click the **Settings** button (gear icon, top right)
3. Click **Restart Space**
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for it to come back online

### Step 2: Restart Backend API

1. Go to: https://huggingface.co/spaces/cosmicmagnetar/opentriage-api
2. Click the **Settings** button (gear icon, top right)
3. Click **Restart Space**
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for it to come back online

### Step 3: Test

Go to your app → Contributor → AI Chat → Send a message

**Should work now! 🎉**

## What Was Fixed

✅ Backend can now send requests to AI engine with API key
✅ AI engine can receive requests with or without API key (fallback)
✅ Error handling improved on both sides
✅ All code pushed and ready to deploy

The only thing left is restarting the spaces to pull the latest code from GitHub!
